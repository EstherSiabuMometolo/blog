ðŸ“– **The first exam session is approaching. Time to go all in!**

In mathematical logic, we took a mock test. It went fairly well, though I made a couple of logical mistakes â€” I need to read the conditions more carefully.

In analysis, I keep practicing problems on **definite integrals**. Learned the main techniques: substitution and integration by parts. Lots of practice â€” and it really helps.

In programming, weâ€™re reviewing topics from the first semester: data types, loops, and functions. Iâ€™ve been solving problems on Codeforces â€” I really enjoy the format and pacing.
