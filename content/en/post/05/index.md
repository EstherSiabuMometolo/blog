ðŸŽ“ **Exams! The first real test!**

I passed the **programming exam** â€” the task was to implement operations with strings and lists. I was nervous, but I wrote everything myself. Got a 4 (out of 5) â€” happy with that!

The logic exam was tough. Lots of formulas, proofs, and not much time. But I made it through! The key is to express your thoughts clearly.

Next week is the final for calculus. I'm reviewing integrals and limit transitions. Really hoping for good results!
