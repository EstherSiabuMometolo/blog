ðŸ’» **Exam prep has officially started!**

In computer science, we reinforced our understanding of functions. During the lecture, we worked on recursion problems â€” challenging but fascinating! Itâ€™s amazing how a function can call itself.

In calculus, we began the topic of **function extrema**. Iâ€™m learning how to find critical points and plot graphs. It finally feels like math is coming to life â€” not just formulas, but real models.

In logic, weâ€™re still proving statements. We were given an assignment on mathematical induction â€” itâ€™s tough so far, but Iâ€™m determined to figure it out.
