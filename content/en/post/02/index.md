ðŸ§  **Logic breaks into daily life!**

We started studying **formal systems and laws of logic**. Weâ€™re learning how to build truth tables and prove tautologies. It feels unusual â€” I can literally feel my thinking becoming more structured.

In mathematical analysis, we moved on to **derivatives**. Practice was quite manageable â€” the main thing is to remember the rules and keep an eye on the signs.

In programming, we had an independent project â€” to build a program that calculates text statistics. It didnâ€™t work perfectly at first, but the most important part is: I wrote the code myself, no copy-paste!
