ðŸ“š **This week was all about programming!**

In class, we covered the basics of loops and conditional statements in Python. The exercises were quite engaging â€” especially those that involved processing user input. During the lab, I built a simple calculator for the first time. I made mistakes, fixed them â€” and that gave me confidence.

In mathematical analysis, we started the topic of **sequence limits**. The theory seems clear at first, but once we got to Îµâ€“Î´ proofs, it became quite a challenge. Fortunately, the professor explained everything with detailed examples.

Over the weekend, I reviewed my notes and started creating flashcards in Anki â€” might come in handy before the exam.
