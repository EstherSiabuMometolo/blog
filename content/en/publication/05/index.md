## Why Automate Scientific Computations?

In almost any research project, the need eventually arises to repeat the same actions: running models, processing data, generating plots, and saving results. When done manually, these tasks consume time, increase the risk of errors, and reduce the reproducibility of experiments.

Automating scientific workflows enables you to:

- 🕒 Save time on repetitive tasks  
- ✅ Reduce the likelihood of human error  
- 🔄 Repeat computations with the same (or new) parameters  
- 📁 Store results in a structured and organized way  
- 🧪 Simplify experiment reproducibility  

## What Can Be Automated?

- **Data preprocessing**: cleaning, filtering, normalization  
- **Model execution**: running simulations, training models, computing metrics  
- **Report generation**: automatically creating tables, plots, PDFs  
- **Scenario comparison**: batch execution with different parameters  
- **Logging and artifact saving**: storing models, weights, configurations  

## Tools for Automation

- 🔧 **Bash, Make, PowerShell** — for system-level task automation  
- 🐍 **Python** — the primary language for scripting and scientific logic  
- 📦 **Snakemake, Airflow, Luigi** — for building scientific data pipelines  
- 📓 **Jupyter Notebook + nbconvert** — for running and exporting analyses  
- 🔁 **Git + Git Hooks** — for automated checks and version-triggered tasks  

## Principles of Good Automation

- 📌 **Separate data, code, and configuration**  
- 📂 **Save intermediate results** for debugging and review  
- 🧪 **Log actions and track versions** (e.g., with MLflow, DVC)  
- 🔄 **Ensure reproducibility**: one script = one consistent result  
- 🧱 **Use modular design**: each step of the process should be a standalone block  

## Example: What Automation Does in a Real Project

Let’s say you're modeling heat transfer:

1. Load and clean geometric data  
2. Define parameters for the heat transfer equation  
3. Run a finite difference simulation  
4. Generate temperature distribution plots  
5. Automatically create a PDF report  

All of this can be done with **a single script**, making your workflow reproducible and easy to share with colleagues or reviewers.

## Conclusion

Automation is not just a convenience — it's a hallmark of quality scientific practice. It allows you to test hypotheses faster, reduce errors, and share your work in an open and reproducible manner.

Start simple: automate one repetitive task — and you’ll immediately see the productivity boost.
