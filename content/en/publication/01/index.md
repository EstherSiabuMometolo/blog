## What is version control?

Version control is a method for tracking changes to project files. It is especially useful when working with code, documentation, articles, or collaborative projects. Without version control systems, it's easy to lose important changes, overwrite others' work, or get confused about which version is current.

A version control system allows you to:

- store the full history of changes;
- revert to previous versions;
- work on the project in parallel branches;
- merge changes from different contributors;
- track who made what changes and when.

## Why use Git?

**Git** is the most popular distributed version control system. It is widely used in professional development, academic research, startups, coursework, and even book writing.

Advantages of Git:

- üì¶ **Change history**: see who modified which file or line and when  
- üåø **Branching**: work on new features or fixes without affecting the main version  
- üß© **Merging**: Git helps combine parallel edits automatically  
- üß† **Data safety**: local commits prevent data loss even without internet  
- ü§ù **Team collaboration**: perfect for distributed teams  
- üåê **Integration** with GitHub, GitLab, and other platforms for CI/CD, bug tracking, and publishing  

## How does Git work?

Git saves your project as a **repository**, which contains:

- a working directory with project files;  
- a staging area (index), where changes are prepared before committing;  
- a commit history, with each commit being a snapshot of changes.

The typical Git workflow includes:

1. Adding files to version control  
2. Making changes and staging them  
3. Creating a commit with a message  
4. Pushing changes to a remote repository or pulling updates from others  

## Where is Git used?

Git is not just for software development. It‚Äôs useful for:

- tracking changes in **scientific articles and LaTeX documents**  
- **publishing research results** in Jupyter Notebook format  
- **collaborative university projects**  
- **teaching courses** by sharing templates and checking code  
- managing **technical documentation and learning materials**  

## Git in research

Many researchers use Git to:

- **replicate experiments** by locking code and dataset versions  
- **ensure transparency** in methods and scripts  
- **publish projects** on GitHub/GitLab with open access  
- **automate** tasks using GitHub Actions (e.g., generating plots, PDFs, reports)  

## Conclusion

Git is more than a technical tool ‚Äî it's a mindset of precision, responsibility, and transparency. By learning Git, you not only improve your coding skills, but also gain the ability to better manage any digital project ‚Äî from code to articles and data analytics.
